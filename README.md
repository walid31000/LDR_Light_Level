ðŸŒŸ Project Highlight: Light Level Sensor Using LDR ðŸŒŸ

I'm excited to share a recent project where I developed a Light Level Sensor using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and an ATmega32 microcontroller!

Project Overview
In this project, we connected the LDR to the ATmega32's pin A0, utilizing the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) to translate light intensity into a voltage. We segmented the light levels into 10 distinct categories, ranging from absolute darkness to the highest intensity of sunlight.

Key Components:
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
ATmega32 Microcontroller
LCD 2x16 Alphanumeric Display
Red LED (activates under low light conditions, specifically below level 5)
Technical Layers:
MCAL Layer:
DIO (Digital Input/Output)
ADC with 10-bit resolution for enhanced precision
HAL Layer:
LCD: Displays light level information
LDR: Senses the ambient light levels
LED: Indicates low light conditions (evening levels)
This project was a fantastic learning experience in working with analog sensors, microcontroller interfacing, and real-time data display. It also underscored the importance of precision in ADC for accurate sensor data interpretation.
